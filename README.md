solitaire-hacking
=================

Proof of Concept for my Splash class in November 2013 on hacking Solitaire. Only tested on Windows 7 64-bit.

Usage
=====

Run solitaire and start a game.
Run the console app

It should print out all of the cards split by their piles (including the deck). Unfortunately, the piles aren't identified by anything other than their number as in the solitaire executable, but again, this is just a proof of concept.
